Question 1:

Created:
	FuzzyBody.java in simulator.model inheriting MovingBody
	FuzzyBodyBuilder.java in simulator.factories
Modified:
	The initFactories() method in Main.java

Question 2:

Created:
	NorthTurns.java in simulator.model as a SimulatorObserver
This class keeps two maps: one to keep track of the number of north turns of each body and another to know whether the body
can turn north (with a boolean).

Modified:
	The Main.java class: Added new option "n" to the buildOptions() method, added a parsing method and added it to the 
parseArgs method. Added a boolean variable set to true if -n is selected. Created a NorthTurns object before the controller.run
in the startBatchMode() method and called northTurns.printStatistics() after the run() method ends.

Question 3

Created:
	MaxSpeedTableModel.java in simulator.view
	MaxSpeedDialog.java in simulator.view

The table model contains three lists: One for bodies, one for time, and one for max speed. In the onAdvance() method the max
speed is calculated and the body, time and max speed are added to the lists. If the list limit has been reached (int _steps)
then the first element of every list is removed. Additionally there is a reset(int n) method which resets the lists and sets
the in _steps to the value of n.

The dialog contains a panel with the table, the buttons, and the spinner. The button calls the reset(int n) method of the 
model using the value in the spinner.

NOTE: There's an unhandled exception if you run the simulator with no file opened and open the new dialog. I have not fixed
it because you shouldn't run the simulator with no file open.

Modified:
	The ControlPanel.java class to add the new _maxSpeedButton. Before this the new model is created, and each time the
button is pressed a new MaxSpeedDialog is created with the model. There is a new constant int for the default N steps.
