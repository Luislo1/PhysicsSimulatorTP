GENERAL
=======

The only thing I didn't like is the use of ArrayList in E3, I don't penalise it in your case because you've been the best in classes.



E1 - FuzzyBody:
===============

- should check fro validity of values in the constructor, not the builder



E2 - Turn North:
================

- no need to construct the object of the option is not provided in the command line arguments

		NorthTurns northTurns = new NorthTurns(controller);


- I think you're doing the counting the other way around, but this not important

- You have some duplication of code



E3 - Max Speed:
===============

- instead of 3 lists you could create an auxiliary class that encapsulates all information

	private List<Body> _bodies;
	private List<Double> _time;
	private List<Double> _maxSpeedList;

- in onAdvance, better take care of the case in which there are no bodies

- Using ArrayList in not efficient because you are removing the first element
